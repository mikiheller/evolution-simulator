# 🐰 Arctic Bunny Evolution Simulator

An interactive web app that teaches **evolution by natural selection** to kids (and curious adults!).

Watch a population of Arctic bunnies evolve over generations as they face environmental challenges. Choose the conditions each year and see which traits help bunnies survive!

## 🎮 How It Works

1. **Start with a bunny family** - 8 bunnies with random traits
2. **Choose an environmental challenge**:
   - ❄️ Harsh Winter (thick fur helps)
   - 🐺 Wolf Pack (speed helps)
   - 🦅 Eagle Attack (camouflage helps)
   - 🥬 Food Shortage (smaller size helps)
   - ☀️ Mild Year (everyone's mostly fine)
3. **Watch natural selection** - Bunnies with better traits for the challenge survive
4. **Breeding time!** - Survivors have babies that inherit their traits (with variation)
5. **Repeat** - Over generations, watch the population evolve!

## 🧬 The Science

This isn't just random - it uses real probabilistic modeling:

- **Bell curve trait distribution** - Most bunnies are average, few are extreme
- **Trait-based survival odds** - Better-adapted bunnies have genuinely higher survival chances
- **Genetic inheritance** - Offspring inherit parent traits with natural variation
- **Mutations** - 30% chance of larger trait changes in offspring
